      <h2>Trinity Montessori School Website Redesign</h2>
      <p>Trinity Montessori School needed a modern website that reflected its commitment to early childhood education while remaining easy for staff to update. Their outdated design, poor mobile experience, and cluttered content structure were no longer serving the needs of prospective parents or current families.</p>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>I completed a full website redesign for Trinity Montessori School, a private Montessori institution in Markham, Ontario. The school needed a modern, mobile-friendly, and easy-to-update website that better reflected its professional yet nurturing approach to early childhood education. Their existing site was outdated in both design and function, with poor mobile usability, a cluttered navigation structure, and a backend that made content updates a hassle for non-technical staff.</p>
      <p>To address these challenges, I rebuilt the site using WordPress and Elementor, designing a clean, warm, and inviting aesthetic that aligns with Montessori values. We overhauled the content architecture to streamline user navigation and ensure key pages like ‚ÄúPrograms,‚Äù ‚ÄúAdmissions,‚Äù and ‚ÄúContact‚Äù were easy to find. A mobile-first approach ensured optimal performance across devices, supported by optimized image loading and custom CSS for responsive styling. On the technical side, I implemented performance enhancements and on-page SEO best practices, including structured metadata and semantic HTML, which significantly boosted site speed and search visibility.</p>
      <p>As a result of the redesign, Trinity Montessori saw a 30% drop in bounce rate within the first three months, with mobile page load time improving from 6.8 seconds to under 2 seconds. Most importantly, the school staff can now manage content confidently and independently, while prospective families are greeted with a modern, welcoming website that reflects the school‚Äôs mission and values.</p>
