      <h2>Robotic Process Automation | Customer Order Transmit Time UiPath Schedule Automation</h2>
      <p>This work showcases how business process automation using Robotic Process Automation tools, like UiPath, along with the importance of problem-solving, technical implementation, notable results and shared best practices deliver measurable business value through technology transformation.</p>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>For an analytics user community learning series, I demonstrated how I led our Transformation &#38; GTM team's effort to reimagine &#38; streamline a Customer's bi-weekly Order Transmit Time Scheduling process using UiPath Robotic Process Automation (RPA). What once took me up to an hour every cycle - merging and transcribing multiple Excel files‚Äîbecame a seamless, low-code UiPath workflow processed in mere minutes under my guidance.</p>

      <p>I kicked off the project by conducting a detailed opportunity assessment: I mapped each step from the field team‚Äôs Excel extracts through to final schedule distribution to Sales Leaders, and classified activities by complexity (manual repetitive, semi-automated, automated). That analysis helped me decide whether attended, unattended, or hybrid automation was the right fit. Using UiPath Studio Edition, I built a ‚Äúone-click‚Äù bot that any team member can trigger, embedding validation checks to catch inconsistencies automatically and remove the manual review bottleneck.</p>
      <p>After deployment, the solution I developed slashed our annual processing time from <strong>26 hours</strong> to just <strong>52 minutes</strong>. The accuracy gains spoke for themselves - my bot‚Äôs validation logic replaced error-prone keystrokes, and feedback from field and support teams confirmed they trusted the new process and enjoyed its simplicity.</p>
      <p>Throughout this project, I reinforced four guiding principles: invest time up front to fully understand the process you‚Äôre automating; aim for quick, high-impact wins to build momentum; design bots with scalability so they adapt to future changes; and iterate continuously. User feedback keeps automation robust and adopted. Leading the Customer Order Transmit Time Schedule Automation demonstrated how targeted RPA can drive efficiency, accuracy, and satisfaction across the business.</p>
