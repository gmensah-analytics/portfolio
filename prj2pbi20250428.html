      <h2>Power BI | Business Performance Dashboard</h2>
      <p>This project showcases a detailed dynamic analytics dashboard built with Power BI, Excel and Power Query, visualizing revenue growth trends and providing operational insights. It integrates multiple data sources, applies advanced DAX measures, and features custom drill-down capabilities.</p>
      <p><a href="" class="btn" target="_blank">Get Hands On (coming soon)</a></p>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>In this project, I analyze three years of revenue data, cleanse and transform it using Power Query, and have designed an insightful, interactive & dynamic Power BI dashboard that highlights key business performance metrics across sales revenue, units sales, and gross profit dimensions.</p>
      <h3>Visualization</h3>

      <p>I began by wrangling sales and account data in Power Query - cleaning up nulls, removing duplicates, additionally crafting a DAX date dimension to enable robust time-based reporting. After validating the data's integrity, I defined relationships and built a handful of core DAX measures (Sales, Quantity, COGS, Gross Profit) along with their YTD and prior-YTD comparables.</p>
      <p>Then came the fun part: I created a simple dynamic slicer that lets a stakeholder toggle between any key metric on the fly, while adaptive comparison measures inform at a glance whether the business is winning or needs to pivot and flex strategy.</p>
      <p>For the design, I sketched a mock-up in PowerPoint, prioritizing clarity through strategically placed header KPI cards displaying only essential metrics, implementing focused slicers for measure and year selection, and selecting streamlined visuals that deliver maximum insight with minimal visual noise, ensuring a stakeholder can quickly extract valuable information without distraction:<br>
        <ul>
          <li><b>line and stacked column combo chart</b> for trend-spotting and quick comparisons</li>
          <li><b>scatter plot</b> to identify outliers (an interactive feature, with drill-down, allowing focused analysis of accounts influencing gross profit percentage and identifying potential growth targets)</li>
          <li><b>treemap</b> to spotlight and drill-down to the bottom-10 countries that are impacting results where a stakeholder might want to drill-down and gain additional insights</li>
          <li><b>waterfall</b> to drill-down, explore and gain insights into monthly drivers</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Along the development journey, I tested every DAX formula in a simple table, and layered in conditional formatting so negative trends jump out in red and wins glow in green.</p>
      <p>In the end, what I built is a no-nonsense ‚Äúsingle pane of glass‚Äù report that surfaces pain points, celebrates wins, identifies opportunities and scales as the data grows - so decision-makers will spend less time poking around and more time making strategic decisions.</p>

        <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Power BI & DAX</li>
          <li>Power Query (Merge & Append Queries, Custom & Conditional Columns, Pivot & Unpivot)</li>
          <li>Microsoft Excel (XLOOKUP, Structured Tables)</li>
          <li>Git/GitHub: Version control and project management</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Data-Driven Operational Insights</b>: Weather, location type, and time of day significantly impact delivery efficiency, providing actionable intelligence for logistics optimization.</li>
        <li><b>Model Performance</b>: Random Forest significantly outperformed Linear Regression (R¬≤ = 0.812 vs. 0.719), demonstrating the importance of capturing non-linear relationships in delivery time predictions.</li>
        <li><b>Customer Experience Factors</b>: Agent ratings strongly correlate with delivery times, suggesting that faster deliveries lead to higher customer satisfaction.</li>
        <li><b>Business Value</b>: Accurate delivery time predictions enable better resource allocation, improved scheduling, more precise ETAs for customers, and ultimately cost reduction at scale.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Process Learnings: The project reinforced the 80/20 rule of data science‚Äî80% of time spent on data cleaning and preparation yields the foundation for successful analysis. Iterative development with proper documentation proved essential for maintaining data integrity.</p>
