## ✍️ Writing Style Reference – Gamal Mensah

This writing style should be applied across all written outputs, including LinkedIn posts, portfolio content, GitHub READMEs, summary reports, and documentation:

- **Use British (UK) English spelling**  
  e.g., "analysed", "optimised", "behaviour", "favour"

- **Do not use em dashes (—)**  
  Use commas or full stops to indicate a break in thought

- **Tone:** Conversational but professional  
  Clear, sharp, and to the point without sounding overly formal

- **Fluff-free and direct**  
  Prioritise clarity over buzzwords; remove filler phrases

- **Emphasise the "so-what"**  
  Always answer *why this insight matters* or *what action it drives*

- **Subtle, clever humour where appropriate**  
  Add a touch of personality when suitable, without compromising professionalism

- **Forward-thinking and practical**  
  Focus on real-world application, stakeholder outcomes, and actionability
