GreenLeaf Florists â€“ Donor Segmentation & Retention Strategy

ðŸ“Œ Featured Post:

Why do so many first-time donors vanish after giving once?

For GreenLeaf Florists, a simulated non-profit floral brand, I analysed over 60,000 donation records from 2022 to 2024. The aim was simple: understand what drives donor loyalty, and what pushes people to drop off after just one interaction.

Using Python, I built a segmentation model to define three donor personas and trained a predictive model to identify who was unlikely to return. I then built a Power BI dashboard to surface the findings in a way that decision-makers could actually use.

Who are we losing, and why?

So-what?  
By targeting high-potential first-time donors with tailored follow-ups, we simulated a lift in overall donor retention of up to 12%. Thatâ€™s not a report, itâ€™s a roadmap.

RoastCo â€“ Behavioural Funnel & Customer Retention

ðŸ“Œ Featured Post:

If the productâ€™s good and the price is right, why arenâ€™t they coming back?

That was the core question behind RoastCo, a fictional specialty coffee brand. I worked with over 45,000 records to explore how customer behaviour shifts after first purchase â€” and why retention rates stall despite positive reviews and high NPS.

Using Python and cohort analysis, I compared patterns between short-term and long-term customers, then built a Power BI dashboard to map out the moments that mattered. The real insight?  

Churn isnâ€™t random. Itâ€™s behavioural.

So-what?  
By surfacing these behavioural drop-offs, we were able to simulate interventions that could lift repeat purchase rates by up to 14%. Not bad for a few hours of smart analytics.
